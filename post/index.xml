      <description>I just successfully completed an operando NEFAXS experiment, investigating dye attachment onto TiO2. Shoutout to Dr. Guo for letting me use the wonderful setup at beamline 8.0.1 and Dr. Liu &amp;amp; Mr. Shang Hsien Hsieh for their support!
I also want to thank Dr. Ivo Utke and Mr. Carlos Guerra-Nu√±ez for their invaluable support in preparing the thin film samples!</description>

      <description>Today I started using the excelent Scribus to prepare my posters for upcomming symposia. Scribus is open source and free (as in freedom of speech and free beer). Their site does an excelent job of explaining why to use Scribus.
A quickstart guide of using Scribus to make scientific poster can be found here.
One thing to note is the inability of Scribus to conveniently deal with tables at this time.</description>

      <description>I just carried out my first synchrotron experiment, with beamtime graciously offered by Prof. Dr. Simon B. Mun. Aim of the experiment was investigating the working of a Ru-POM.</description>
